Database columns will be listed in the order they appear in on each of the tables. Square brackets contain the true ResultSet index when attempting to call table data via a Business Object method using a generic SQL Select statement ("SELECT * from Products;", "SELECT * FROM Administrators;", etc.). Parentheses contain the intended Java datatype (and the corresponding ResultSet getValue() method).
